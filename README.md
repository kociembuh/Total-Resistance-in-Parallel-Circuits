# Total-Resistance-in-Parallel-Circuits
A quick tool to calculate total resistance in a parallel circuit with up to 20 resistors.

This is my first project using C++. I'm certain the code is horribly inefficient, but I'm not yet familiar enough with the language to get it down any further. Regardless, I hope everything is laid out neatly and the comments are descriptive enough such that you can understand my thought process and order of operations.

I am aware that using something called a range-based for loop would be cleaner than the basic ones used here, but I will have to implement those once I understand them better. Cheers.
